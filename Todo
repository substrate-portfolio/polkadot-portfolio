UI:
  - Fetching Coin Data:
    [] Live coin data

  - Networks and Accounts:
    [] Auto complete for networks: We should have a list of hardcoded networks (copy pasta from polkadot.js/apps), and upon adding a new network, you should be able to just type “Polkadot” and it should potentially suggest a known ws endpoint for it.
    [] Networks should have icons (hardcoded)
    [x] Accounts should have icon as well (https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/tree/master/packages/react-identicon#readme)
		[x] Validate accounts on input 

  - Actions on Token Table:
    [] Filtering small amounts
    [] Filtering by Token Name
    [] Filtering table by values
    [] Grouping stuff by headliners (harder)
    [] Add unit test.

  - [ ] UI Network Preludes: ALL, DOTSama, Polkadot, Kusama
  - [ ] Account Import from Extensions

CORE:
  [] Provide API to fetch coins data from various sources and keep them up to date
  [] Detect address format (ETH + BTC)
  [x] Dictionary for network names to WSS urls (to be maintained by community) (Re-export from polkadot-js/app/endpoints)
  [] Dictionary for asset sources to be exported from Core
  [] Native assets and derivatives should be distinguished (task for Kian)
  [x] Clean up Core/UI related functions from class
  [] Add unit test
  [] Remove TS-ignore/Ts-No checks.
  [x] Refactor core with better design

CLI:
  [x] Move summary from Core to CLI

Delivery:
  [] README.md + CONTRIBUTING.md
  [] Github deployment soon so we can shill it a bit and also request tips
